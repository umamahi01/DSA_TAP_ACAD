Stack ==>
        stack is a linear data structure which operates in LIFO OR FILO pattern.
        whatever the element pushed last will first come out from the stack.
        and whatever element pushed first will come out last .
        
        it has two major operations 
                                -> 1.push();
                                -> 2.pop();
       
        stack is a data structure that can be implemeted using other data structures 
                                -> Arrays
                                -> list ->1.ArrayList
                                        ->2.LinkedList
        
        top => the top is always pointing to the top of the stack 
        
        push()=> the element add at the top of the stack is called push operation.
        
        pop()=> the element remove from the top of the stack is called pop operation.

StackOverFlow =>
                when the size of the stack is full and we try to add/push element into the stack it cause
                StackOverFlow Condition.

StackUnderFlow =>
                when the are no elements inside the stack  and we try to pop/remove the element from the 
                stack it will cause StackUnderFlow Condition.
